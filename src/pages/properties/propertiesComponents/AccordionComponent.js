                    The Lake Joy House is the main house on the property. It is an expansive farmhouse that sits atop a
                    hill overlooking the private pond, offering a gorgeous view no matter what. It is a short distance
                    from The Cottage, making it ideal to rent in conjunction for special events. There is plenty of
                    dining space and outdoor entertainment space as well. Just a short walk to the water, you can enjoy
                    a morning of fishing off the dock or cool off in the afternoon with a swim. At night, you will
                    experience breathtaking stargazing views while sitting by the flagstone patio and outdoor fireplace.
